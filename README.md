# 🎵 nvim-yt-player

A premium, lightweight, asynchronous YouTube audio player built directly inside Neovim. Powered by **mpv** and **yt-dlp**, it plays audio seamlessly in the background without freezing your editor or requiring complex Node.js/browser extensions.

---

## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Zero-Freeze Asynchronous Playback**: Stream fetching and caching run entirely in the background. Neovim remains 100% responsive.
- **🏗️ Zero-Dependency Backend**: Pure Lua talking to a local `mpv` process over a UNIX domain IPC socket. No bloated servers or external daemons needed.
- **🎨 Premium Player Layouts**:
  - `:YT player` — Toggles a dedicated side-panel buffer featuring a beautiful custom ASCII bounding-box, a live bouncing music visualizer, an interactive progress slidebar, and volume/speed tracking.
  - `:YT mini` — Toggles a gorgeous floating window with the same premium visual player layout.
- **🔍 Interactive Search Picker (`:YT search`)**: Query YouTube and pick a result using a beautiful floating picker displaying channel names and track durations.
- **📁 Local Playlists (`:YT playlists`)**: Save tracks instantly with `s` and manage them inside a split-pane local playlist manager.
- **📝 Interactive Queue Editor (`:YT queue_edit`)**: Reorder tracks with `J`/`K` or delete them with `dd` in real-time.
- **🎵 Seamless Playlist Ingestion (`:YT queue_playlist`)**: Rapidly ingest and parse YouTube playlists containing 100+ tracks without blocking the UI.
- **⏩ Auto SponsorBlock**: Automatically skip sponsors, intros, and non-music off-topic segments (enable in config).
- **📻 Autoplay Radio Mode (`:YT radio`)**: Endless recommendation stream (enabled by default). Spawns the YouTube Mix playlist matching your active song, deduplicates against active queue and history, and seamlessly appends fresh tracks before your queue ends.
- **📊 Lualine & Statusline Integration**: Formats playing state, volume, speed, and real-time progress bars smoothly for statuslines.
- **🕐 Persistent Play History (`:YT history`)**: Stores recently played tracks so you can jump back or queue them later.
- **🎨 Currently Playing Track Highlight**: The active track is visually highlighted in green across the queue editor, playlist manager, and history picker.
- **🔔 Customizable Notifications**: Control the format of track-change notifications with placeholders like `{title}`, `{artist}`, and `{icon}`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Override defaults by passing options into `setup()`:

```lua
require("yt-player").setup({
  statusline = {
    enabled = true,
    format = "{icon} {title} - {artist} [{position}/{duration}]",
    icon_playing = "▶",
    icon_paused = "⏸",
    truncate_title = 30,
    progress_width = 10,
  },

  search = {
    limit = 10, -- default number of results returned per search query
  },

  notifications = {
    enabled = true,
    notify_on_track_change = true, -- notify when a new song starts playing
    format = "▶ {title} - {artist}", -- customizable notification format
    icon_playing = "▶", -- icon used in notification format
    icon_paused = "⏸", -- icon used when paused
    timeout = 3000, -- notification timeout in ms
  },

  player = {
    queue_display_limit = 5, -- number of upcoming tracks to show in the player layout
  },

  keymaps = {
    enabled = false, -- set to true to enable global keymaps
    prefix = "<leader>y",
    play = "p",
    pause = "s",
    toggle = "t",
    next = "n",
    prev = "b",
    mute = "m",
    volume_up = "+",
    volume_down = "-",
    seek_forward = "f",
    seek_backward = "r",
    speed_up = ">",
    speed_down = "<",
  },
  
  radio = {
    enabled = true, -- set to false to disable autoplay radio by default
    limit = 5,      -- number of related tracks to fetch at a time
  },
  
  sponsorblock = false, -- set to true to automatically skip YouTube sponsor segments
})
```

### Statusline Customization
Use these placeholders to customize your statusline:
- `{icon}` — Play/Pause status icon (`▶` / `⏸`)
- `{title}` — Current track title
- `{artist}` — Channel / Uploader name
- `{position}` — Current playback position (e.g. `2:45`)
- `{duration}` — Total track duration (e.g. `4:10`)
- `{progress}` — Interactive progress bar (e.g. `▓▓▓░░░░░░░`)
- `{volume}` — Volume percentage
- `{speed}` — Speed multiplier (e.g. `1.25x`)
- `{radio}` — Autoplay radio status icon (renders `📻` when enabled)

### Notification Customization
Use these placeholders to customize track-change notifications:
- `{title}` — Current track title
- `{artist}` — Channel / Uploader name
- `{icon}` — Playing icon (default `▶`)

Example configurations:
```lua
-- Minimal notification
format = "{title}"

-- Include artist
format = "▶ {title} - {artist}"

-- With icon placeholder
format = "{icon} Now playing: {title}"
```

### Lualine Integration
Add `yt-player` directly to your lualine configuration sections:
```lua
require("lualine").setup({
  sections = {
    lualine_x = { "yt-player" }
  }
})
```

### Highlight Groups
All highlight groups can be customized to match your colorscheme. Override them in your Neovim config:

```lua
-- Player UI highlights
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerTitle", { fg = "#bd93f9", bold = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerArtist", { fg = "#6272a4" })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerProgress", { fg = "#50fa7b" })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerProgressBg", { fg = "#44475a" })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerControls", { fg = "#8be9fd" })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerVolume", { fg = "#ffb86c" })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerVolumeBg", { fg = "#44475a" })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerRadio", { fg = "#ff79c6" })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerQueue", { fg = "#f8f8f2" })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerQueueCurrent", { fg = "#50fa7b", bold = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerBorder", { fg = "#6272a4" })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YtPlayerHelp", { fg = "#6272a4" })

-- Currently playing track highlights (green by default)
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YTQueueCurrent", { fg = "#50fa7b", bold = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YTPlaylistCurrent", { fg = "#50fa7b", bold = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "YTHistoryCurrent", { fg = "#50fa7b", bold = true })
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Neovim (Lua) ── UNIX Socket ──➔ mpv ──➔ yt-dlp ──➔ YouTube Stream
```

The plugin spawns a headless, detached background `mpv` process with IPC enabled. Multiple Neovim instances safely share the same `mpv` process via standard client process registration. The socket is automatically cleaned up when the last client closes.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **No Audio?** Check that both `mpv` and `yt-dlp` are functioning correctly on your system by playing a URL directly:
  ```bash
  mpv --no-video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  ```
- **Outdated yt-dlp?** If YouTube streams fail to parse, update `yt-dlp` to get the latest decoders:
  ```bash
  yt-dlp -U
  ```
- **Warning: mpv exited?** Ensure `mpv` is compiled with Lua support. Most native distribution package managers compile it with Lua support by default.
- **Searching Fails?** Ensure Neovim has internet access and your geographic region is not blocked or rate-limited by YouTube's API filters.

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this download videos to my computer?**  
A: No. It streams only the audio tracks in real-time, saving disk space and bandwidth.

**Q: Can multiple Neovim instances control the same audio?**  
A: Yes! A shared client registry coordinates instances. When you start audio in one instance, others can view the statusline or control the active player.
